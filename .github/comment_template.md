Hey {{ .hub_admins }}! :wave
I notice there is still pending information about the new hub deployment.
The information pieces still missing, are the ones listed below:

- {{ .pending_info }}

Details about each of them can be found in the top comment. Also, please feel free to ping the "2i2c/engineering" for additional guidance.

After the form in the top comment is filled in, an engineer will be assigned and will start deploying the new hub ðŸš€.
Thank you!
