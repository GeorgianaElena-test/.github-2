Hey {{ .hub_admins }}! :wave
I notice there is still pending information about the new hub deployment.
The information pieces still missing, are the ones listed below.

- {{ . }}

Details about each of them can be found in the top comment. But if you have questions about any of them, please ping the "2i2c/engineering" and they will help you.

After the form in the top comment is filled in, an engineer will be assigned and will start deploying the new hub ðŸš€.
Thank you!
